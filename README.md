## ðŸš€ Build a RAG Using LangChain with Google Gemini

In this project, weâ€™ll build a text-to-text **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application using LangChain by configuring the Google Gemini Pro model. This app will generate high-quality text responses based on user prompts. Ready to dive into some cutting-edge AI tech? Letâ€™s go! ðŸ˜Ž

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to develop an **LLM** (Large Language Model) application using **LangChain** and **Google Gemini Pro**. The app takes a few sentences as input and generates relevant paragraphs of text in response. It's a perfect way to explore how AI can produce human-like text in real-time.

### What You Can Do:

- **Build with LangChain**: Use LangChainâ€™s open-source framework to power your text generation app.
- **Contextual Responses**: The app will understand user prompts and respond in a contextual manner.
- **Fine-Tune the Model**: Fine-tune the LLM using relevant data to enhance performance.
- **Optimize Outputs**: Experiment with parameters like `temperature`, `top-k`, and `top-p` to control the output.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **LangChain**: For building and enhancing LLM-powered applications.
- **Google Gemini Pro**: To power our text generation with a state-of-the-art model.
- **Python**: The language that ties it all together.

## ðŸ¤– Skills Youâ€™ll Use

- Machine Learning
- Natural Language Processing
- Data Science & Data Analysis
- Generative AI

## ðŸ¤– Example Tasks You Can Do

- **Text Generation**: Input a few sentences and get paragraphs of meaningful content in return.
- **Tune Parameters**: Adjust parameters like `temperature` to make your model more or less creative in its responses.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Build a system that augments text generation with relevant data retrieval to improve the contextual accuracy of the output.
